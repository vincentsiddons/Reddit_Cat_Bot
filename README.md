# Reddit_Cat_Bot

This project attempts to predict the breed of cats in reddit post images. The bot will make a comment under the post predicting the cat's breed using a fine-tuned verion of OpenAI's CLIP. The pkl file is too big for github.

The dataset used to fine-tune this model: https://github.com/Aml-Hassan-Abd-El-hamid/datasets

I split the test set in half to create a validation set.
